## Introduction

Select your top drivers and teams, get drink recommendations based on your favorites!

F1 Takes Vegas is an easy to use application to learn a little more about all of the 2022 current Drivers and constructors, and save the ones you like the most to your dashboard. This project represents the Turing School of Software and Design Module 3 Showcase, in which we were tasked with demonstrated newly learned skills in React.js. Additionally, this project features a custom back-end/API, built via Express.js.
